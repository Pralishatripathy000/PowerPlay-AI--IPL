## 📌 Overview

**PowerPlay AI** is an end-to-end machine learning sports analytics system that predicts IPL match winners using historical ball-by-ball IPL data (2008–2025), engineered match-level features, and gradient-boosting models (XGBoost & CatBoost). The project includes a production-ready **FastAPI backend** and a **Lovable/React dashboard** for real-time prediction display.

## 🔍 What Makes PowerPlay AI Different?

Most IPL prediction projects available online follow a similar, simplified pattern — feed team names, toss result, and venue into a basic classifier and call it done. PowerPlay AI was designed with a fundamentally different philosophy.

### ❌ What typical IPL ML projects do

```
team1 + team2 + venue + toss_winner  →  basic classifier  →  win/loss
```

Usually built on Logistic Regression or Random Forest, evaluated only on historical accuracy, with no external season validation.

### ✅ What PowerPlay AI does differently

**1. Ball-by-ball → Match Intelligence**
Rather than using surface-level inputs, the entire 283,678-row ball-by-ball dataset was transformed into structured match-level analytical features that actually reflect *how* T20 games are won — capturing run rate, wicket pressure, batter contribution, extras load, innings-based momentum, and team scoring patterns.

**2. Real External Validation**
The model was validated on a completely separate IPL 2026 dataset (39 unseen matches) — a dataset that never touched the training pipeline. This directly addresses the overfitting problem common in most IPL ML projects, where models score 95%+ on historical splits but fail on new seasons.

**3. Advanced Boosting Models**
XGBoost and CatBoost were compared against each other — not just basic algorithms — and the final model was selected based on both historical accuracy *and* 2026 generalization performance.

**4. Production Architecture, Not Just a Notebook**
The system includes a FastAPI backend with a `/predict` REST endpoint, model serialization via Joblib, and a live React/Lovable dashboard — making it a deployable sports analytics product, not just a Jupyter experiment.

### 💛 Built with Cricket Passion

This project was also built out of genuine love for IPL and cricket. As an RCB fan, the idea started as a fun side project to explore how machine learning could interpret match momentum and pressure in one of the most unpredictable T20 leagues in the world. With the **IPL Final on 31 May**, the timing felt perfect to blend cricket excitement with real ML engineering.

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

The ball-by-ball dataset was aggregated into a **match-level dataset** using `match_id`.

**Engineered features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `team1`, `team2` | Teams playing the match |
| `venue`, `city` | Match location |
| `toss_winner`, `toss_decision` | Toss outcome |
| `stage` | Tournament stage (group / playoff / final) |
| `match_total_runs` | Total runs in the match |
| `batter_total_runs` | Total batter runs |
| `extra_total_runs` | Total extra runs |
| `total_wickets` | Wickets fallen |
| `team_runs`, `team_balls`, `team_wicket` | Innings-level aggregates |
| `run_rate` | Runs per over |
| `extras_percentage` | Proportion of extras |

**Target Variable:**

```
team1_win   →   1 = team1 won   |   0 = team2 won
```

## 🤖 Model Details

### XGBoost Classifier ✅ *(Final Model)*

```python
Model:      XGBClassifier
Training:   IPL 2008–2025
Validation: Train-test split
External:   IPL 2026 match data
```

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Historical Test Accuracy | **91.45%** |
| 2026 External Accuracy | **61.54%** |

### CatBoost Classifier *(Comparison)*

```python
Model:   CatBoostClassifier
Note:    Handles categorical features natively
Usage:   Model comparison with XGBoost
```

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Historical Test Accuracy | **91.03%** |
| 2026 External Accuracy | **56.41%** |

### Why XGBoost?

XGBoost was selected as the final model because it outperformed CatBoost on both historical test data *and* unseen 2026 external data, demonstrating better generalization to new seasons.

## 📈 Results Summary

| Model | Historical Accuracy | 2026 External Accuracy |
|-------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| XGBoost ✅ | **91.45%** | **61.54%** |
| CatBoost | 91.03% | 56.41% |

> 💡 The drop in 2026 accuracy (vs historical) is expected — new seasons introduce unseen team compositions, player transfers, and match dynamics. 61.54% on completely unseen data is a solid generalization benchmark.
